## Helpful Notes & Tips

With the square sized pastry (5 sheet pack) you will want to halve the recipe

Put the pastry in the fridge so it stays a little firm whilst defrosting

Peel the backing off the pastry!

## Ingredients

- 3-5 apples
- 20g diced butter
- Puff pastry sheets
- 3 TBSP apricot jam (1.5 is fine for the smaller sheets)
- 3 TBSP white sugar (1.5 is fine for the smaller sheets)
- ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon (1/4 is fine for smaller sheets)
- lemon (to stop apples from going brown)

## Steps

1. Peel and core the apples, cut into thin slices
2. Set apple in lemon water while you do the others to stop it from browning
3. Create a slight scoring around the edge to give your pastry a border. Stab the inside all over with a fork.
4. Drain apples and lay them out in an orderly fashion from right to left and head toward the inside. Once done, preheat oven.
5. Mix sugar and cinnamon so it binds together and then season the apples
6. Pop apricot jam in the microwave for 15 seconds and paint it on
7. Sprinkle about 4-6 cubes of butter
8. Place in oven at 200 degrees c, you want to see pastry nice and puffed and apple sinking slightly. (20-25 minutes)
9. Let it cool for ~10 minutes and serve with icing sugar or ice cream
10. Done
