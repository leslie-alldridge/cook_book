## Helpful Notes & Tips

Melt butter and dip the muffins into sugar + cinnamon by hand

Bakes in 25 minutes

## Ingredients

    - 2 cups all-purpose flour + 2 teaspoons for coating apples
    - 1½ teaspoons baking powder
    - ½ teaspoon salt
    - 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon + 1/2 teaspoon for coating apples
    - 2 cups diced apples (about two apples)
    - 113g unsalted butter, room temperature
    - 1 cup granulated sugar
    - 2 large eggs
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    - ½ cup milk

## For the Topping

    - 30g butter melted
    - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
    - 1 tsp ground cinnamon

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 190c Spray muffin tins with bakers spray or coat well with shortening or butter and flour, making sure to discard any excess flour from the tins after coating.

2. Sift together 2 cups flour, baking powder, salt, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a medium bowl. Set aside.

3. Mix 2 teaspoons flour with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Toss diced apples with the flour/cinnamon mixture to coat apples in a separate bowl. Set aside.

4. Cream together butter and sugar until lightened in color, about 3 minutes. Add an egg, one at a time, taking care to fully incorporate before adding the other. Mix in vanilla.

5. Gently fold in flour mixture, alternating with milk. Stir until just combined. Fold in diced apples and scoop mixture into prepared muffin tins, filling about 2/3 to 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick or skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

6. Prepare topping for muffins while the muffins are baking by melting the butter and allowing to cool slightly. Pour butter into a separate bowl sized easy for dipping tops of muffins. Mix together granulated sugar and cinnamon in a separate bowl and set aside.

7. Once muffins have baked, remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly in the muffin tin. Then, remove each muffin and brush the butter on with a pastry brush (or dip into the melted butter) and then into the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place onto a plate to finish cooling.
