## Ingredients

- 1 and a half cups of milk
- 2 TBS white vinegar
- 2 cups self raising flour
- 2 TBS sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- two tsp vanilla essence
- two eggs
- 3 tbs melted butter (40 grams)

## Steps

Before starting, prepare the ingredients and create buttermilk with 2-3 TBSP of vinegar and whole milk. Let it stand for 5-10 minutes.

1. In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk to combine.
2. In a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup, add the buttermilk, melted butter, and egg yolks and whisk to combine.
3. Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and gently fold with a rubber spatula until just combined.
4. Add the egg whites and fold until just combined. Be sure not to overmix. Some lumps are okay.
5. Let the batter rest for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Add the butter to a cast iron skillet and heat over medium low heat. Once the butter has melted and is bubbling, reduce the heat to medium-low and add â…“ cup (75 g) of batter to the pan.
7. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface. If adding any toppings like chocolate chips or blueberries, sprinkle over the pancake. Flip the pancake over and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.
8. Serve the pancakes with butter and maple syrup.
